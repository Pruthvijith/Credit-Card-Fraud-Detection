# Credit Card Fraud Detection

**To build a machine learning model that is capable of detecting fraudulent transactions**

The problem statement chosen for this project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions with the help of machine learning models.

In this project, the analysis is made on customer-level data that has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group. 

The data set is taken from the Kaggle website and has a total of 2,84,807 transactions; out of these, 492 are fraudulent.
